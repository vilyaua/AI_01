📚 Module 1 Homework: Fundamentals of GenAI Tools

✅ Step 1: Try Out a Local Model
* Install LM Studio https://lmstudio.ai
       * Download a model of your choice (e.g., `gemma3-4b-it`, `llama-3.2-3b-instruct`)
* Upload a text file and an image, and experiment with prompting against the model
* Explore how it responds differently depending on the prompt type and input format

✅ Step 2: Build a Custom Assistant
* If you're a ChatGPT Plus user:
  * Create a CustomGPT: https://chatgpt.com/gpts/editor
* If you're using Gemini:
  * Create a GEM: https://gemini.google.com/app
* Upload a document of your choice and configure the assistant with your own custom instructions
* Test it with questions related to the uploaded content

✅ Step 3: Record a Walkthrough
* Schedule a quick video call with yourself (e.g., Google Meet)
* Record a screen-sharing demo with transcripts enabled, where you show both:
  * LM Studio interaction
  * CustomGPT or GEM interaction

✅ Step 4: Submit Your Work
* Upload your video recording and transcript to Google Drive, by creating your folder here (name it using your Name and Surname)
* Make sure permissions are set to "Anyone at Ciklum with the link can view"
* Submit the URLs to the  form provided - Google Form for your submissions


⭐ BONUS: Vibe Coding for Presales Scenario
· This optional assignment is designed for participants who want to deepen their practical skills and prepare for real-world client-facing scenarios. 

Step 1 – Select a Domain: Imagine you are preparing for a presales call in one of Ciklum’s core domains (e.g., banking, healthcare, e-commerce, travel). 
Step 2 – Leverage Your LLM: Use the LLM from the earlier assignment (preferably your CustomGPT or GEM) to generate an initial prompt that could be used to prototype a simple Proof of Concept (PoC) application relevant to your chosen domain. 
Step 3 – Build with a Vibe Coding Platform: Choose a platform of your choice (Firebase, Lovable, Bolt.new, etc.) and use the generated prompt to kickstart your application. Iterate with additional prompts until you have a version you would feel confident presenting in a presales meeting. 
Step 4 – Record a Walkthrough: Prepare a short video walkthrough of your application. Explain what you built, demonstrate its core functionality, and highlight the workflow you used to refine your prompts. 
Step 5 – Learning Outcomes: Gain hands-on experience with vibe coding platforms; understand limitations and challenges; practice the importance of precise prompt writing; build confidence for future presales activities.

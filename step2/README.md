   - **Description**: "Expert AI consultant helping with AI/ML questions and solutions"
   - **Instructions**: Copy and paste content from `custom_instructions_customgpt.txt`
   - **Knowledge**: Upload all three knowledge base documents

3. **Test Your Assistant**
   - Ask questions from the test questions list (see below)
   - Document responses

### For GEM (Gemini)

1. **Access Gemini Apps**
   - Visit: https://gemini.google.com/app
   - Sign in with Google account
   - Click "Create" or "New GEM"

2. **Configure Your Assistant**
   - **Name**: "AI Consultant Assistant" (or your choice)
   - **Description**: "Expert AI consultant helping with AI/ML questions and solutions"
   - **Instructions**: Copy and paste content from `custom_instructions_gem.txt`
   - **Knowledge**: Upload the same three knowledge base documents

3. **Test Your Assistant**
   - Ask the same questions as CustomGPT
   - Document responses for comparison

## Test Questions

Use these questions to test both assistants:

### Basic Questions
1. What is machine learning?
2. Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning
3. What are the key challenges in AI implementation?

### Document-Specific Questions
4. What services does TechSolutions Inc. offer?
5. What is the implementation process for AI projects?
6. What are the best practices for data collection?

### Analysis Questions
7. Compare the advantages of cloud vs on-premise AI deployment
8. What factors should be considered when selecting an AI model?
9. How do you calculate ROI for an AI project?

### Practical Questions
10. I want to implement a fraud detection system. What steps should I follow?
11. What are common pitfalls in AI implementation and how to avoid them?
12. Explain the agile AI development process

### Complex Questions
13. Based on the knowledge base, create a step-by-step plan for implementing an AI solution
14. What are the key differences between the three types of machine learning?
15. How would you recommend monitoring an AI system in production?

## Comparison Checklist

When testing both assistants, compare:

- [ ] Response accuracy
- [ ] Relevance to knowledge base
- [ ] Clarity and structure
- [ ] Use of examples
- [ ] Citation of sources
- [ ] Handling of ambiguous questions
- [ ] Response time
- [ ] Follow-up question handling
- [ ] Professional tone
- [ ] Practical applicability

## PoC Scenario

For the Delivery Manager perspective, use this scenario:

**Client**: A mid-size healthcare provider wants to implement AI for medical image analysis.

**Your Task**: Use the CustomGPT/GEM to:
1. Understand their requirements
2. Recommend an approach based on the knowledge base
3. Create a high-level implementation plan
4. Estimate timeline and considerations

**Questions to Ask Your Assistant**:
- "How would you approach implementing an AI solution for medical image analysis?"
- "What are the key considerations for healthcare AI projects?"
- "What is the typical timeline for such a project?"
- "What are the main risks and how to mitigate them?"

## Expected Outcomes

After completing Step 2, you should have:

1. ✅ Working CustomGPT assistant
2. ✅ Working GEM assistant
3. ✅ Test results and responses documented
4. ✅ Comparison analysis
5. ✅ PoC scenario completed
6. ✅ Notes on differences between platforms

## Notes

- Upload the same documents to both assistants for fair comparison
- Use the same test questions for both
- Document responses side-by-side for easy comparison
- Note any differences in behavior, accuracy, or helpfulness

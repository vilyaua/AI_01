## General Demo Best Practices

### 1. Preparation
- **Test everything beforehand**: Ensure all tools work smoothly
- **Have backup plans**: If one tool fails, have alternatives ready
- **Prepare sample files**: Have text documents and images ready
- **Time management**: Keep total demo to 15-20 minutes

### 2. Structure
- **Introduction** (1 min): Set context and expectations
- **Main Demo** (12-15 min): Show tools in action
- **Comparison** (2-3 min): Highlight differences and use cases
- **Q&A** (2-3 min): Address questions

### 3. Key Messages to Emphasize
- **Local Models (LM Studio)**:
  - Privacy and data security
  - No internet required
  - Cost-effective for high-volume use
  - Good for sensitive data

- **Cloud Models (CustomGPT/GEM)**:
  - More powerful and accurate
  - Better context understanding
  - Easy to set up and use
  - Regular updates and improvements

### 4. Handling Questions
- **"Which is better?"**: "It depends on your use case. Local for privacy, cloud for power."
- **"What about costs?"**: "Local has upfront costs, cloud has per-use costs."
- **"Is my data safe?"**: "Local models keep data on your device, cloud models use your data for training (check policies)."

### 5. Closing
- Summarize key takeaways
- Provide next steps
- Offer to send demo recording
- Schedule follow-up if interested

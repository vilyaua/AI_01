PROMPT 2: Creative Writing
================================================================================
Prompt: Write a short poem about technology and nature.


gemma:2b:
  Time: 13.05s
  Response:
    Silicon forests bloom,
    A digital symphony.
    Birdsong is replaced by code,
    A symphony of bits and roads.
    
    Screens flicker, trees stand still,
    The digital world takes hold.
    But in this vibrant clash,
    A fragile beauty is told.
    
    The firefly's spark fades fast,
    The screen's light cannot last.
    The natural world fades into the machine,
    A reminder that we are all in this machine.

llama3.2:3b:
  Time: 37.44s
  Response:
    In silicon halls, we find our place,
    Where circuitry beats with digital pace,
    But as we gaze upon the screen's bright light,
    We forget the world outside in all its might.
    
    The trees stand tall, their leaves rustling free,
    A gentle breeze that whispers secrets to me,
    The sun sets low, a fiery glow,
    As nature's beauty beckons us to slow.
    
    Let's find a balance 'twixt tech and earth,
    Where innovation meets the natural birth,
    For in the harmony of human and land,
    Lies a future bright, with a gentle h... [truncated]

PROMPT 5: Complex Reasoning
================================================================================
Prompt: If a train travels 120 km in 2 hours, and another train travels 180 km in 3 hours, which train is faster?


gemma:2b:
  Time: 13.94s
  Response:
    To compare the speeds of the two trains, we can calculate their respective speeds in km/h.
    
    Speed of the first train = 120 km/h ÷ 2 hours = 60 km/h
    
    Speed of the second train = 180 km/h ÷ 3 hours = 60 km/h
    
    Therefore, the second train is equally fast as the first train, traveling at 60 km/h.

llama3.2:3b:
  Time: 44.60s
  Response:
    To determine which train is faster, we need to calculate the speed of each train.
    
    Speed = Distance / Time
    
    Train 1:
    Distance = 120 km
    Time = 2 hours
    Speed = 120 km / 2 hours = 60 km/h
    
    Train 2:
    Distance = 180 km
    Time = 3 hours
    Speed = 180 km / 3 hours = 60 km/h
    
    Since both trains have the same speed (60 km/h), they are tied in terms of speed. Neither train is faster than the other.
